Facebook is an American for-profit corporation and an online social media and social networking service based in Menlo Park, California. 
The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004, 
by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.

The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; 
however, later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, 
and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities
and eventually to high school students as well.
Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, 
though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws.
The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students.
